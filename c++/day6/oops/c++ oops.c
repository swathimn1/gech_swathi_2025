/**
 * characteristics of oops
 * class ->blueprint/template of an object ,it increases code reusability, it include data members and member functions,data members->variables inside the class and member functions->functions inside the class.
 *
 * object ->instance of a  class,real world entity.
 * data abstraction ->hiding the implementation details from the user
 * data hiding ->hiding the implementation details from the user 
 * encapsulation ->binding the data and methods into a single unit
 * polymorphism ->multiple forms ->overloading and overriding ->same method but different parameters and same method but different implementation
 * inheritance->inheritance is a mechanism in which one class inheritance the properties of another class.
