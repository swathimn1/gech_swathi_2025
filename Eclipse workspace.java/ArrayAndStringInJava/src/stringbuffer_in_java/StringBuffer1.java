		 * 
		 * ðŸ”¹ final String str2 = "123"; Since str2 is marked final, the compiler knows
		 * its value at compile time.
		 * 
		 * So, when you do str2 + "456", it becomes "123" + "456" â†’ "123456" at compile
		 * time.
		 * 
		 * Therefore, str4 also refers to the same interned object as str1.
		 * 
		 * String str3 = "123"; Also refers to "123" in the string pool.
		 * 
		 * But not final, so the compiler does not treat it as a constant.
		 * 
		 * ðŸ”¹ String str5 = str3 + "456"; Since str3 is not final, the compiler treats
		 * it as a runtime expression.
		 * 
		 * So "123" + "456" is computed at runtime using StringBuilder under the hood.
		 * 
		 * The result is a new String object on the heap, not the one in the pool.

		// All wrapper classes are immutable
		/*
		 * In Java, beyond the String class, several other built-in classes are
		 * immutable, meaning their state cannot be changed after they are created.
		 * These include: Primitive Wrapper Classes: All the wrapper classes for
		 * primitive data types are immutable. This includes: 1.Integer .2Byte 3.Long
		 * 4.Float 5.Double 6.Character 7.Boolean 8.Short ================ Java 8 Date
		 * and Time API Classes (java.time package): The classes introduced in the
		 * modern Date and Time API are designed to be immutable, ensuring thread-safety
		 * and predictable behavior. Examples include: 1.LocalDate 2.LocalTime
		 * 3.LocalDateTime 4.Instant 5.ZonedDateTime =================
		 * 
		 * BigInteger and BigDecimal: ========================== These classes, used for
		 * arbitrary-precision arithmetic, are also immutable. Operations on these
		 * objects return new instances with the modified values.
		 * ============================================================================
		 * 
		 * StackTraceElement: This class, used in building exception stack traces, is
		 * immutable. ==================
		 * 
		 * Most enum classes: ================== While not a strict rule, most enum
		 * classes in the standard API are implicitly immutable, as their instances
		 * represent fixed constants. ====================================== File:
		 * ==================== Although File objects represent external entities (files
		 * on the system) whose state can change, the File object itself, representing
		 * the path, is immutable. Font and BasicStroke (from java.awt): These classes,
		 * used in graphics operations, are also immutable.
